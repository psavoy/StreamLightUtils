\usage{
LAI_proc_phenofit(Site, fit_method)
}
\arguments{
\item{Site}{The Site ID}

\item{fit_method}{The curve fitting method to pass onto phenofit ("AG", "Beck", 
"Elmore", "Gu", "Klos", "Zhang")}
}
\description{
This function generates a continuous series of LAI from downloaded
from the lpdaac AppEEARS download portal. This is done through the phenofit
R package https://github.com/kongdd/phenofit. A rough fit is done using a
weighted Whittaker smoother and then curve fitting is done using an assymetric
Gaussian function.
